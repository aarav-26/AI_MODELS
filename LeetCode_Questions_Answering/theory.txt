QUESTION 8: String to Integer (atoi)
DIFFICULTY: Medium
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

	Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (&quot; &quot;).
	Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is &#39;-&#39; or &#39;+&#39;, assuming positivity if neither present.
	Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
	Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.

Return the integer as the final result.

Example 1:

Input: s = &quot;42&quot;

Output: 42

Explanation:

The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: &quot;42&quot; (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: &quot;42&quot; (no characters read because there is neither a &#39;-&#39; nor &#39;+&#39;)
         ^
Step 3: &quot;42&quot; (&quot;42&quot; is read in)
           ^

Example 2:

Input: s = &quot; -042&quot;

Output: -42

Explanation:

Step 1: &quot;   -042&quot; (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: &quot;   -042&quot; (&#39;-&#39; is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: &quot;   -042&quot; (&quot;042&quot; is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
               ^

Example 3:

Input: s = &quot;1337c0d3&quot;

Output: 1337

Explanation:

Step 1: &quot;1337c0d3&quot; (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: &quot;1337c0d3&quot; (no characters read because there is neither a &#39;-&#39; nor &#39;+&#39;)
         ^
Step 3: &quot;1337c0d3&quot; (&quot;1337&quot; is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^

Example 4:

Input: s = &quot;0-1&quot;

Output: 0

Explanation:

Step 1: &quot;0-1&quot; (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: &quot;0-1&quot; (no characters read because there is neither a &#39;-&#39; nor &#39;+&#39;)
         ^
Step 3: &quot;0-1&quot; (&quot;0&quot; is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
          ^

Example 5:

Input: s = &quot;words and 987&quot;

Output: 0

Explanation:

Reading stops at the first non-digit character &#39;w&#39;.

Constraints:

	0 <= s.length <= 200
	s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), &#39; &#39;, &#39;+&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, and &#39;.&#39;.

	&#39;.&#39; Matches any single character.​​​​
	&#39;*&#39; Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Example 1:

Input: s = &quot;aa&quot;, p = &quot;a&quot;
Output: false
Explanation: &quot;a&quot; does not match the entire string &quot;aa&quot;.

Example 2:

Input: s = &quot;aa&quot;, p = &quot;a*&quot;
Output: true
Explanation: &#39;*&#39; means zero or more of the preceding element, &#39;a&#39;. Therefore, by repeating &#39;a&#39; once, it becomes &quot;aa&quot;.

Example 3:

Input: s = &quot;ab&quot;, p = &quot;.*&quot;
Output: true
Explanation: &quot;.*&quot; means &quot;zero or more (*) of any character (.)&quot;.

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 20
	1 <= p.length <= 20
	s contains only lowercase English letters.
	p contains only lowercase English letters, &#39;.&#39;, and &#39;*&#39;.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:

	n == height.length
	2 <= n <= 105
	0 <= height[i] <= 104



----------------------------------------

QUESTION 12: Integer to Roman
DIFFICULTY: Medium
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/

Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

			Symbol
			Value

			I
			1

			V
			5

			X
			10

			L
			50

			C
			100

			D
			500

			M
			1000

Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

	If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
	If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
	Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

Example 1:

Input: num = 3749

Output: &quot;MMMDCCXLIX&quot;

Explanation:

3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places

Example 2:

Input: num = 58

Output: &quot;LVIII&quot;

Explanation:

50 = L
 8 = VIII

Example 3:

Input: num = 1994

Output: &quot;MCMXCIV&quot;

Explanation:

1000 = M
 900 = CM
  90 = XC
   4 = IV

Constraints:

	1 <= num <= 3999



----------------------------------------

QUESTION 13: Roman to Integer
DIFFICULTY: Easy
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

	I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
	X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
	C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Example 1:

Input: s = &quot;III&quot;
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = &quot;LVIII&quot;
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 3:

Input: s = &quot;MCMXCIV&quot;
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 15
	s contains only the characters (&#39;I&#39;, &#39;V&#39;, &#39;X&#39;, &#39;L&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;M&#39;).
	It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

QUESTION 26: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
DIFFICULTY: Easy
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

	Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
	Return k.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
	-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
	nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

QUESTION 27: Remove Element
DIFFICULTY: Easy
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

	Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
	Return k.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:

	0 <= nums.length <= 100
	0 <= nums[i] <= 50
	0 <= val <= 100

QUESTION 29: Divide Two Integers
DIFFICULTY: Medium
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/

Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [&minus;231, 231 &minus; 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.

Example 1:

Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.

Example 2:

Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3

QUESTION 30: Substring with Concatenation of All Words
DIFFICULTY: Hard
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/

You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.

A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

	For example, if words = [&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;,&quot;ef&quot;], then &quot;abcdef&quot;, &quot;abefcd&quot;, &quot;cdabef&quot;, &quot;cdefab&quot;, &quot;efabcd&quot;, and &quot;efcdab&quot; are all concatenated strings. &quot;acdbef&quot; is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.

Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = &quot;barfoothefoobarman&quot;, words = [&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;]

Output: [0,9]

Explanation:

The substring starting at 0 is &quot;barfoo&quot;. It is the concatenation of [&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is &quot;foobar&quot;. It is the concatenation of [&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;] which is a permutation of words.

Example 2:

Input: s = &quot;wordgoodgoodgoodbestword&quot;, words = [&quot;word&quot;,&quot;good&quot;,&quot;best&quot;,&quot;word&quot;]

Output: []

Explanation:

There is no concatenated substring.

Example 3:

Input: s = &quot;barfoofoobarthefoobarman&quot;, words = [&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;the&quot;]

Output: [6,9,12]

Explanation:

The substring starting at 6 is &quot;foobarthe&quot;. It is the concatenation of [&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;the&quot;].
The substring starting at 9 is &quot;barthefoo&quot;. It is the concatenation of [&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;the&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;].
The substring starting at 12 is &quot;thefoobar&quot;. It is the concatenation of [&quot;the&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;].

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 104
	1 <= words.length <= 5000
	1 <= words[i].length <= 30
	s and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.

QUESTION 31: Next Permutation
DIFFICULTY: Medium
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/

A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

	For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

	For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
	Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
	While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]

QUESTION 38: Count and Say
DIFFICULTY: Medium
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

	countAndSay(1) = &quot;1&quot;
	countAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding of countAndSay(n - 1).

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string &quot;3322251&quot; we replace &quot;33&quot; with &quot;23&quot;, replace &quot;222&quot; with &quot;32&quot;, replace &quot;5&quot; with &quot;15&quot; and replace &quot;1&quot; with &quot;11&quot;. Thus the compressed string becomes &quot;23321511&quot;.

Given a positive integer n, return the nth element of the count-and-say sequence.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4

Output: &quot;1211&quot;

Explanation:

countAndSay(1) = &quot;1&quot;
countAndSay(2) = RLE of &quot;1&quot; = &quot;11&quot;
countAndSay(3) = RLE of &quot;11&quot; = &quot;21&quot;
countAndSay(4) = RLE of &quot;21&quot; = &quot;1211&quot;

Example 2:

Input: n = 1

Output: &quot;1&quot;

Explanation:

This is the base case.

Constraints:

	1 <= n <= 30

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

Example 3:

Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []

Constraints:

	1 <= candidates.length <= 30
	2 <= candidates[i] <= 40
	All elements of candidates are distinct.
	1 <= target <= 40
